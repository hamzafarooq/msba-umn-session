This repository contains code and data for loading and processing a dataset of hotel reviews and descriptions in Paris, as well as using the OpenAI API to perform various natural language processing tasks.

**Dataset** <br />
The dataset used in this project is a collection of hotel reviews and descriptions for hotels located in Paris, France. It contains various attributes such as hotel name, review text, reviewer rating, and more. The dataset is stored in a CSV file and can be found in the repo.

**OpenAI API** <br />
The OpenAI API is a powerful tool for performing various natural language processing tasks, including question-answering, summarization, and semantic search. In this project, we will be using the OpenAI API to perform these tasks on the hotel review dataset.

**Question-Answering**  <br />
We will use the OpenAI API's question-answering capabilities to answer questions related to the hotel reviews, such as "What is the average rating for hotels in Paris?" or "Which hotel in Paris has the most positive reviews?"

**Summarization** <br />
We will use the OpenAI API's summarization capabilities to generate short summaries of the hotel reviews. These summaries can be used to give a quick overview of a particular hotel or to compare different hotels based on their reviews.

**Semantic Search**  <br />
We will use the OpenAI API's semantic search capabilities to find hotels that are similar to a given query. For example, if a user is looking for a hotel that is "quiet and secluded", we can use semantic search to find hotels that are described in similar terms.

**Usage** <br />
To use the code in this repository, you will need to have an OpenAI API key. Once you have obtained an API key, you can set it as an environment variable by running the following command:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

**Conclusion** <br />
By combining the power of the OpenAI API with a dataset of hotel reviews and descriptions in Paris, we can gain valuable insights into the preferences and opinions of hotel guests. This project demonstrates how NLP techniques can be used to analyze large datasets and extract meaningful information.
